# Overview
The Movie and TV Show Web Scraping Project is a Python-based web scraping tool that extracts movie and TV show data from various websites, including genres, titles, year of release, OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms, and more. The project leverages the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to automate the process of fetching web pages, parsing HTML, and extracting relevant data. The scraped data is then saved to an Excel file for easy analysis and visualization.
